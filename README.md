# SP-Minimal

[Minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) is a theme developed by [Steve Smith (orderedlist)](https://github.com/orderedlist) and belongs the official themes used by the Github Pages automatic page generator. I used the theme for many of my course pages, because it is simple and elegant. [SP-Minimal](https://github.com/eueung/hugo-sp-minimal) is a port of the theme for use within Hugo. The theme supports single- and multi-page rendering, code highlighting, Disqus comment system and Google Analytics.
